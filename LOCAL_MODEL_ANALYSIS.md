# Local Model Analysis for CYOA AI RPG

## Mythomax-L2-13B Evaluation

### Specifications
- **Size:** 13 billion parameters
- **Architecture:** Llama 2-based (2023)
- **Context Window:** 4k default, extendable to 8k-16k with RoPE scaling
- **Strengths:** Storytelling, roleplaying, creative writing
- **Format:** Available in GGUF, GPTQ, GGML
- **Hardware:** Can run on ~10-16GB VRAM

### Critical Assessment for CYOA AI RPG

#### ❌ **WOULD NOT RECOMMEND - Multiple Dealbreakers**

**1. Context Window Too Small (CRITICAL ISSUE)**
- Your game needs: **32k-128k tokens** based on analysis
- Mythomax offers: **4k-16k tokens** maximum
- Gap: **2-8x too small**

**Why this breaks the game:**
- Base context alone: 8-25k tokens
- Game history (32k config): +7.6k tokens
- Game history (128k config): +76k tokens
- **Total needed: 15.6k - 101k tokens per request**

**With Mythomax's 16k max:**
- Can't fit full base context + history
- Would need to truncate world state severely
- NPCs would lose personality/memory
- Combat calculations might fail
- AI would "forget" recent events constantly

**2. Outdated Model (2023)**
- Released 2 years ago (ancient in AI time)
- Based on Llama 2 (superseded by Llama 3, 3.1, 3.3)
- Worse instruction following than modern models
- Less reliable XML output

**3. Size Too Small for Complex Tasks**
- 13B parameters vs modern 70B+ models
- Struggles with:
  - Multi-step reasoning (event detection)
  - Structured output (XML parsing)
  - Simultaneous context tracking (NPCs + items + combat)
  - Consistency across long sessions

**4. No Evidence of XML Proficiency**
- Designed for creative writing, not structured output
- No documentation of XML generation capability
- Your game requires reliable XML for:
  - Event detection (10+ different formats)
  - NPC generation (complex nested structures)
  - Location generation
  - Item creation

### What Would Happen If You Used It

**Immediate Problems:**
- Context overflow errors (prompt too long)
- Truncated/missing game state
- NPCs forgetting their personalities mid-conversation
- Combat events not detected properly
- Malformed XML responses (breaking event parsing)

**Workarounds (all hurt quality significantly):**
- Remove all history (AI has no memory)
- Show only 1-2 NPCs instead of 4
- Remove party members from context
- Strip down item descriptions
- Simplify combat to bare minimum
- **Result: 60-80% quality loss, barely playable**

### Hardware Requirements (If You Tried Anyway)

| Quantization | VRAM | Speed | Quality |
|--------------|------|-------|---------|
| Q4_K_M | 10GB | Fast | Medium |
| Q5_K_M | 12GB | Medium | Good |
| Q8_0 | 16GB | Slow | Best |

**Usable GPUs:**
- RTX 3060 12GB (barely, Q4 only)
- RTX 3080 10GB (Q4 only)
- RTX 4070 Ti 12GB (Q5)
- RTX 4090 24GB (Q8, overkill for this model)

## Running Local Models - Practical Guide

### Software Options

#### 1. **Ollama** (Easiest)
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Run Qwen 2.5 72B
ollama pull qwen2.5:72b
ollama serve

# Configure your game to use: http://localhost:11434/v1
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Dead simple setup
- ✅ Automatic model management
- ✅ OpenAI-compatible API
- ✅ Your code works as-is (just change endpoint)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Less control over quantization
- ⚠️ Slightly slower than optimized setups

#### 2. **LM Studio** (GUI, Easy)
- Download from lmstudio.ai
- Click to download models
- Built-in OpenAI-compatible server
- Great for testing different models

**Pros:**
- ✅ Beautiful GUI
- ✅ Easy model switching
- ✅ Performance monitoring

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Less efficient than command-line tools

#### 3. **llama.cpp + KoboldCpp** (Advanced)
- Maximum performance
- Full control over quantization
- More complex setup

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fastest inference
- ✅ Most efficient VRAM usage
- ✅ Advanced features (RoPE scaling, etc.)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Command-line only
- ⚠️ Steeper learning curve

### Configuration for Your Game

**Update `config.yaml`:**
```yaml
ai:
  # For Ollama
  endpoint: "http://localhost:11434/v1"
  apiKey: "not-needed"  # Ollama doesn't need a key
  model: "qwen2.5:72b"

  # Or for LM Studio
  # endpoint: "http://localhost:1234/v1"
  # model: "qwen2.5-72b-instruct"

  maxTokens: 6000
  temperature: 0.7
  baseTimeoutSeconds: 300  # Local can be slower
```

**No code changes needed!** Your game already supports OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

## Performance Expectations

### Generation Speed (Tokens/Second)

| Model | Hardware | Speed | Usability |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **Qwen 2.5 72B Q4** | 2× RTX 4090 | 15-25 t/s | ✅ Great |
| **Qwen 2.5 72B Q4** | 1× RTX 4090 | 5-10 t/s | ⚠️ Slow but usable |
| **Qwen 2.5 32B Q5** | 1× RTX 4090 | 30-45 t/s | ✅ Excellent |
| **Mythomax 13B Q4** | RTX 3060 12GB | 40-60 t/s | ❌ Fast but won't work |

**What speed means for gameplay:**
- 20+ t/s: Responses in 5-15 seconds (feels instant)
- 10-20 t/s: Responses in 15-30 seconds (acceptable)
- 5-10 t/s: Responses in 30-60 seconds (slow but playable)
- <5 t/s: Responses in 1-2 minutes (frustrating)

### Response Time Per Turn

**With Qwen 2.5 72B on 2× RTX 4090:**
- Player action: ~20 seconds
- Event checks (10 concurrent): ~3-4 minutes total
- **Full turn: ~4-5 minutes**

**Optimization:**
- Run event checks sequentially instead of concurrent (saves VRAM)
- Reduces to 6-7 events to check
- **Optimized turn: ~2-3 minutes**

**With cloud API (GLM 4.6):**
- Full turn: ~30-90 seconds (much faster due to concurrent processing)

## Final Recommendations

### For Your Specific Question: Mythomax

**❌ DO NOT USE MYTHOMAX for this game**

Reasons:
1. Context window 4x-8x too small
2. Will require 60-80% quality reduction to fit
3. Outdated 2023 model
