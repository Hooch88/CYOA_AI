  &lt;description&gt;A quaint village nestled among towering pine trees. The air is filled with the scent of fresh pine and wood smoke from chimneys. Villagers go about their daily routines, tending to livestock and trading goods at the bustling market square. The village is surrounded by a protective wooden palisade, with a single gate leading to a winding forest path. At night, the pines seem to whisper secrets on the breeze, hinting at ancient magic in the woods beyond.&lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;baseLevel&gt;2&lt;/baseLevel&gt;
