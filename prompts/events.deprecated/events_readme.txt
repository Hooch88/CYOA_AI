This folder holds small, single sentence prompts to check for various events in the AI's output prose.  These events are compiled into a numbered list and sent as one single prompt, asking for simple answers such as yes, no, n/a, or an item or NPC name.  An example of an event might be the current player or NPC picking up something and putting it into their inventory, and the event prompt for that event might read:

"Did the player or anyone else in the scene pick up one or more items? If so, list these items separate by semicolons. Otherwise, answer N/A."

"Did any entity attack any other entity?  If so, answer in the format [attacker] -> [target]. Otherwise, answer N/A."
