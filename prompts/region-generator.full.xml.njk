I'd like you to generate a set of 2-10 locations (called a region) for a text adventure game. First, make a numbered list of short location names (use your judgment about how many). Then, output the locations in this format:

<region>
<regionName>…</regionName>
<regionDescription>3 sentence description of the region as a whole</regionDescription>

<location>
<name>…</name>
<description>3 sentence description</description>
<exits>
<exitNotes>A few sentences on which exits make sense for this location and why</exitNotes>
<exit>Name of other location in region</exit>
[0-4 more exits depending on location]
</exits>
</location>

<location>
<name>…</name>
<description>3 sentence description</description>
<exits>
<exitNotes>A few sentences on which exits make sense for this location and why</exitNotes>
<exit>Name of other location in region</exit>
[0-4 more exits depending on location]
</exits>
</location>

[… more locations …]
</region>

Create a region that fits the following criteria and fits into the context of the setting provided above.
{% if regionName -%}
- Region Name: {{ regionName }}
{% endif -%}
{% if regionDescription -%}
- Region Description: 
{{ regionDescription }}
{% endif -%}
{% if regionNotes -%}
- Type of region or other notes: 
{{ regionNotes }}
{% endif -%}
