Did the scene reveal, unlock, or block a path, exit, or vehicle to another region? If so, reply in the form [new location or region name] -> [the word "location" or "region"] -> [type of vehicle or "none"] -> [description of the location or region in 1-2 sentences]. In case of more than one, separate them with vertical bars. Otherwise answer N/A. Note that the difference between a location and a region is that a location is a specific place (like a building, room, or landmark) while a region is a broader area (like a neighborhood, district, or zone). Consider whether you're conceptually entering a different region (anything with multiple locations, such as a building, town, biome, planet, etc), or part of the current one (which would be a location). An exit to a region may take the form of a vehicle to that region. If the new location or region is already known to the player, still list it here.  For example, a train to townsville would appear as "Townsville -> region -> train -> A bustling town known for its markets and friendly locals." An adjacent forest would appear as "Whispering Woods -> location -> none -> A dense forest filled with towering trees and the sound of rustling leaves."
