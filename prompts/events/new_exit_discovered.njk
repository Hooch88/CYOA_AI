Did the scene reveal, unlock, or block a path or exit? If so, reply in the form ["location" or "region"] -> [new location or region name] -> [description of the location or region in 1-2 sentences]. In case of more than one, separate them with semicolons. Otherwise answer N/A. Note that the difference between a location and a region is that a location is a specific place (like a building, room, or landmark) while a region is a broader area (like a neighborhood, district, or zone). Consider whether you're conceptually entering a different region, or part of the current one (which would be a location).
