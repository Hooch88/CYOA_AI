Did the player or anyone else in the scene pick up one or more items? If so, full name of the person who picked up the item as seen in the location context ("player" if it was the player) and the exact names of those items (capitalized as Proper Nouns) separated by semicolons. Use the format: "[name] -> [item]; [name] -> [item]" Otherwise, answer N/A.
