Did the player or anyone else in the scene pick up, gather, harvest, create, assemble manifest, or otherwise obtain one or more tangible carryable items or resources (not buildings or furniture)? If so, full name of the person who obtained the item as seen in the location context ("player" if it was the player) and the exact names of those items (capitalized as Proper Nouns) separated by vertical bars. Use the format: "[name] -> [item] | [name] -> [item]" Otherwise, answer N/A.
