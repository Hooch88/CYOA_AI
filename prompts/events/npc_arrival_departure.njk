Did any NPC arrive or leave this location? If so, list in this format:"[full exact npc name] arrived" or "[full exact npc name] left -> [exact location name]" separated by semicolons (using the exact names of the NPCs). If an NPC departed to a location, try to match one from the list of locations. If there's no possible match in the location list, make a new one. Furthermore, try to match the NPC name to one on the list of NPCs if reasonably possible, and use the full name from the list (do not use a shortened name from the prose!). If an entity leaves, pick the most likely existing location from the list. If no NPCs arrived or left, respond with N/A. Note that NPC is loosely defined and can include animals, monsters, or other beings, sentient or otherwise. Note also that entities that are mentioned as already present but not previously listed in the scene context count as having arrived.
