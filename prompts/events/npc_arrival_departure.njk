Did any NPC arrive or leave this location? If so, list in this format:"[full exact npc name] arrived" or "[full exact npc name] left -> [exact location name]" separated by vertical bars (using the exact names of the NPCs). If an NPC departed to a location, try to match one from the list of locations. If there's no possible match in the location list, make a new one. Furthermore, try to match the NPC name to one on the list of NPCs if reasonably possible, and use the full name from the list (do not use a shortened name from the prose!). If an entity leaves, pick the most likely existing location from the list.  If no NPCs arrived or left, respond with N/A. Note that NPC is loosely defined and can include animals, monsters, or other beings, sentient or otherwise. If any NPCs present in textToCheck aren't mentioned in this list: [{% for npc in npcs %}{{ npc.name }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}] respond "[full exact npc name] arrived" for that NPC regardless of whether they arrived.
