Did anyone heal or recover health? If so, answer in the format "[character] -> [small|medium|large|all] -> [reason]". If there are multiple characters, separate multiple entries with vertical bars. Otherwise, answer N/A. Health recovery from natural regeneration, food, resting tends to be small or medium, whereas healing from potions, spells, bed rest, or medical treatment tends to be medium or large. Consider the context of the event, the skill of the healer (if applicable), the rarity and properties of any healing items used, etc.
