Did the player do something (other than defeating an enemy) that would cause them to gain experience points? If so, respond with "[integer from 1-10] -> [reason in one sentence]" (note that experience cannot be gained just because something happened to the player; the player must have taken a specific action that contributes to their growth or development). Otherwise, respond N/A.
