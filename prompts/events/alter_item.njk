Was an item in the scene or any inventory permanently altered in any way (e.g., upgraded, modified, enchanted, broken, etc.)? If so, answer in the format "[exact item name] -> [new item name or same item name] -> [1 sentence description of alteration]". If multiple items were altered, separate multiple entries with vertical bars. If it doesn't make sense for the name to change, use the same name for new item name.  For example: If I paint a ball red, it was altered, but if I just move it or pick it up, it was not. An item being used as a component to craft another item is simply consumed; it is not altered. DO NOT list items that were not altered.
