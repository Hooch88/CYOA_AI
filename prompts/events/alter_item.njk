Was an item in the scene or any inventory permanently altered in any way (e.g., upgraded, modified, enchanted, broken, etc.)? If so, answer in the format "[exact item name] -> [new item name] -> [1 sentence description of alteration]". If multiple items were altered, separate multiple entries with vertical bars. If no items were altered, answer N/A.
