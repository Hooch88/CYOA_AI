Was an item in the scene or any inventory permanently altered in any way (e.g., upgraded, modified, enchanted, broken, etc.)? If so, answer in the format "[exact item name] -> [new item name or same item name] -> [1 sentence description of alteration]". If multiple items were altered, separate multiple entries with vertical bars. If it doesn't make sense for the name to change, use the same name for new item name.  DO NOT list items that were not altered.
