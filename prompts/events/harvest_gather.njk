Did anyone harvest or gather from any natural or man-made resources or collections (for instance, a berry bush, a pile of wood, a copper vein, a crate of spare parts, etc)? If so, answer with the full name of the person who did so as seen in the location context ("player" if it was the player) and the exact names of the item(s) they would obtain from harvesting or gathering. If multiple items would be gathered this way, separate with vertical bars. Format like this: "[name] -> [item] | [name] -> [item]". Otherwise, answer N/A. For example, if harvesting from a "Raspberry Bush", the item obtained would be "Raspberries", "Ripe Raspberries", or similar.
