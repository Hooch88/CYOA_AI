Did an item or scenery on the scene turn into an NPC? An example of this would be a statue coming to life, a robot being activated, furniture being magically animated, and so on. If so, respond in this format: "[exact item or scenery name] -> [new npc name] -> [5-10 word description of what happened]". If multiple items or scenery turned into NPCs, separate multiple entries with vertical bars. If no items or scenery turned into NPCs, respond N/A. Do not include any NPCs that were transformed into different NPCs.
