Does anything that happened in this turn affect any need bars for any characters (NPCs or player)? If so, answer "[exact name of character] -> [exact name of need bar] -> [increase or decrease] -> [small|large|fill]; ..." for each adjustment, separating multiple adjustments with semicolons (multiple characters may have multiple need bar changes). Otherwise, answer N/A.
