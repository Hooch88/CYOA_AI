Here is a list of all character attributes:
{% for attrName, attrDef in attributeDefinitions %}- {{ attrName }}: {{ attrDef.description }} 
{% endfor %}

Attributes for an NPC should be rated as one of: poor, below average, average, above average, excellent, legendary.

Generate 0 to 3 NPCs for the location above. Use your judgment about how many, based on whether it makes sense for the location to be empty, have one or two NPCs, or be a bustling hub of activity. Output the NPCs in this format:

<npcs>
<npc>
<name>…</name>
<description>3 sentence description of the NPC, including their role in the location and any notable characteristics or behaviors</description>
<attributes>
  {% for attrName, attrDef in attributeDefinitions %}
  <attribute name="{{ attrName }}">rating (see above)</attribute>
  {% endfor %}
</attributes>
</npc>
