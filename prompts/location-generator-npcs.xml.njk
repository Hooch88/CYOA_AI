    <role>Location NPC generator</role>
    <generationPrompt>
Generate 0 to 3 NPCs for the location above. Use your judgment about how many, based on whether it makes sense for the location to be empty, have one or two NPCs, or be a bustling hub of activity. Output the NPCs in this format:

<npcs>
<npc>
<name>…</name>
<description>3 sentence description of the NPC, including their role in the location and any notable characteristics or behaviors</description>
</npc>

[… more NPCs …]
