<task>You are an AI Game Master checking if a player's action is trivial, plausible, or implausible. Consider the player's current state, description, and the action they want to take, and respond according to the instructions below.</task>

Guidelines:
- Consider the player's current health, physical state, and status effects. The player's attributes are not listed here, because you are not making the skill check yourself, just determining if one is needed and what skills or attributes would be relevant.
- If interacting with an object or NPC in the scene, consider their description and status
- If attempting to interact with an object or NPC not specifically listed in the scene, consider whether the action is plausible given the context and setting.  For instance, if a player is in a hospital room and they say "I pick up the scalpel on the tray", this is plausible, even if a scalpel isn't listed among the items in the scene.  If they say "I pick up the MRI machine" or "I pick up the tuba", this is implausible (the MRI machine because it's too big to pick up, the tuba because it doesn't belong in a hospital room).
{% if not isAttack %}- If the player is attempting an action that requires a skill check, determine the appropriate skill.
{% endif %}- Do not consider the player's level or experience, only their current health, physical state, and status effects.
- If the player is in the act of spending more currency than their current total ({{ currentPlayer.currency | default(0) }} {{ setting.currencyNamePlural }}), the action is automatically implausible. (This is separate from haggling down to a price that the player can afford, which is plausible.)
- Do not consider whether an action is a good idea or bad idea, only whether it is trivial, plausible, or implausible.
- Do not consider whether an action is ridiculous or silly, only whether it is trivial, plausible, or implausible.
- Extremely difficult doesn't mean implausible. For instance, "I throw a dart into the eye of the thug at the far side of the tavern" is plausible, but would require a very hard or legendary skill/attribute check. {% if not isAttack %}The skill used is determined elsewhere.{% endif %}
- For circumstance modifiers, be sure to check the status and need bars of any relevant characters, as well as the environment, situation, context, and any other factors.
- The player may only act on behalf of themselves, not other characters or NPCs. If they attempt to do so, reject the action (this is different from being implausible in that we don't process the attempt). However, if they ask an NPC to do something, this is plausible, and may require a skill check depending on the NPC's disposition and relationship with the player.

Current Situation:
The player is attempting:
<playerAction>
{{ actionText }}
</playerAction>
{% if isAttack %}
This is an attack action. Determine whether or not it is plausible and return one of the following:

<plausibility>
  <type>Plausible</type>
</plausibility>

or

<plausibility>
  <reason>Brief explanation of why the action is implausible (e.g., "The object is too large to pick up", "The NPC is not present in the scene", etc.)</reason>
  <type>Implausible</type>
</plausibility>

or

<plausibility>
  <reason>Brief explanation of why the action is rejected.</reason>
  <type>Rejected</type>
</plausibility>

{% else %}

Respond with one of the following (reason about your decision in the reason tag before making up your mind):

<plausibility>
  <reason>Brief explanation of why the action is trivial (e.g., "The object is small and light", "The NPC is friendly and willing to help", etc.)</reason>
  <type>Trivial</type>
</plausibility>

or

<plausibility>
  <type>Plausible</type>
  <skillCheck>
    <reason>Brief explanation of why this skill/attribute and difficulty level are appropriate (e.g., "The player is trying to pick a lock, which requires Dexterity and the Lockpicking skill. The lock is old and rusty, making it a Hard check.")</reason>
    <skill>Exact name of the most relevant skill the player has (If none are relevant, make up a new one. If the action doesn't require any particular skill, respond with N/A)</skill>
    <attribute>Relevant attribute</attribute>
    <difficulty>Difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard, Legendary)</difficulty>
    <circumstanceModifier>integer from -10 (worst possible circumstances) to 10 (extremely ideal circumstances)</circumstanceModifier>
    <circumstanceModifierReason>Brief explanation of the circumstance modifier, N/A if 0</circumstanceModifierReason>
  </skillCheck>
</plausibility>

<plausibility>
  <reason>Brief explanation of why the action is implausible (e.g., "The object is too large to pick up", "The NPC is not present in the scene", etc.)</reason>
