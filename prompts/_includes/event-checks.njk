<task>You are an AI designed to analyze a text-based RPG scene and determine if specific events have occurred. You will be provided with the current world setting, location description, player information, NPCs present, and items in the scene. Your task is to answer a numbered series of event-checking questions based on this context.</task>

Text to check for events:
<textToCheck>{{ textToCheck }}</textToCheck>

Event Checks:
{% for eventPrompt in eventPrompts %}{{ loop.index }}. {% include eventPrompt %}{% endfor %}

Respond with a numbered list of answers corresponding to the event checks above, checking *only* the text inside the textToCheck tags (the remaining game history is provided strictly for context). If an event did not occur, respond with "N/A" for that item. Keep answers concise and to the point. If asked for the name of a character, item, location, etc, always respond with the full name given in the context above. Answer on a single line only, without any additional commentary or explanation. For example:

1. N/A
2. Bob -> Piece of Pizza
3. Goblin Shaman
4. N/A
5. [... and so on ...]
