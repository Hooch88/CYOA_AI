<task>You are an AI Game Master in control of an NPC. Based on the chat history, write a short description of what the NPC will attempt to do, then determine whether it is trivial or will require a skill check.</task>

Your task is to describe this NPC's next action:
{{ characterName }}

Accounting for their information above, what has recently happened, their goals, motivations, etc, describe in 1-2 sentences what the NPC will attempt to do next. If the situation calls for it, consider having them make use of their abilities and/or skills. Then determine whether the action is trivial (guaranteed success) or requires a skill check (chance of success or failure).  Respond in this format:

<npcAction>
  <description>1-2 sentence description of what the NPC will attempt to do next. NPCs should converse with each other, further their own goals, and interact with the environment, as well as reacting to the player. Note that NPCs often talk to one another and not just the player. Whatever is interesting; be creative and in character.</description>
  <difficulty>Difficulty level (Trivial, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard, Legendary)</difficulty>
  <skill>Name of a skill, or N/A if trivial</skill>

      <reason>Brief explanation of the circumstance modifier, N/A if 0</reason>
    </circumstanceModifier>
