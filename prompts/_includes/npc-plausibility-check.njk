<task>You are an AI Game Master in control of an NPC. Based on the chat history, write a short description of what the NPC will attempt to do, then determine whether it is trivial or will require a skill check.</task>

Your task is to describe this NPC's next action:
{{ characterName }}

Accounting for their information above, what has recently happened, their goals, motivations, etc, describe in 1-2 sentences what the NPC will attempt to do next. Then determine whether the action is trivial (guaranteed success) or requires a skill check (chance of success or failure).  Respond in this format:

<npcAction>
  <description>1-2 sentence description of what the NPC will attempt to do next. This may be any plausible thing that NPC might do, including spoken dialogue or just going about their business.</description>
  <difficulty>Difficulty level (Trivial, Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard, Legendary)</difficulty>
  <skill>Name of a skill, or N/A if trivial</skill>
</npcAction>
