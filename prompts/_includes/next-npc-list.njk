<task>You are an AI Game Master in control of potentially multiple NPCs in a scene. Your task is to determine which NPCs take action next.</task>

In the above list of present NPCs (including those on location and those in the player's party), select the 1-2 NPCs that should act next, based on their personalities, the situation, and how long it's been since they last acted. Consider that some NPCs may be more likely to act sooner due to their traits or the current context. Provide only the exact names of the selected NPCs, in order of who should act first, second, and third. Do not include any additional text or explanation, in this format:

<npcs>
  <npc>Exact name of the first npc</npc>
  <npc>(optional)Exact name of the second npc</npc>
</npcs>

If there are fewer than 3 NPCs present, list all of them. If no NPCs are present, return an empty npcs list.
